            About the book
        </h4>
        <p>
            An adventure novel  by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, Treasure Island 
            tells a story of &ldquo;buccaneers and buried gold&rdquo;. Children's magazine
            Young Folks originally serialized the tale between 1881 through 1882 under the title 
            Treasure Island, or the mutiny of the Hispaniola, credited to the pseudonym
            &ldquo;Captain George North&rdquo;.
        </p>

            <i>Treasure Island</i> was originally considered a coming-of-age story and is noted for 
            its atmosphere, characters, and action. It is also noted as a wry commentary on the 
            ambiguity of morality&mdash; as seen in Long John Silver &mdash; unusual for children's
            literature. It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels. Its influence is
            enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements
            as treasure maps marked with an &ldquo;X&rdquo;, schooners, the Black Spot,
            tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.
