                    Chapter 13 - How My Shore Adventure Began
                </h3>
                <p>
                	THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was
                	altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had
                	made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed
                	about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.
                	Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint
                	was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,
                	and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some
                	singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.
                	The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.
                	All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four
                	hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in
                	configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly
                	cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.
                </p>
                <p>
                	The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms
                	were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the
                	whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had
                	to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my
                	eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this
                	standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never
                	learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an
                	empty stomach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its
                    grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we
                    could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at
                    least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were
                    fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone
                    would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart
                    sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I
                    hated the very thought of Treasure Island.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any
                    wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped
                    three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow
                    passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of
                    the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering,
                    and the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command
                    of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as
                    loud as the worst.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well," he said with an oath, "it's not forever."
                    I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone
                    briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the
                    island had relaxed the cords of discipline.
                    All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship.
                    He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the
                    chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never
                    hesitated once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "There's a strong scour with the ebb," he said, "and this here passage
                    has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade."
                </p>
                <p> We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of
                    a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on
                    the other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up
                    clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a
                    minute they were down again and all was once more silent.
                    The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming
                    right down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops
                    standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one
                    there. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this
                    pond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore
                    had a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship we could see nothing
                    of the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if
                    it had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the
                    first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the
                    seas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the
                    surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks
                    outside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage--a smell of
                    sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing
                    and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I don't know about treasure," he said, "but I'll stake my wig there's
                    fever here."
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly
                    threatening when they had come aboard. They lay about the deck growling
                    together in talk. The slightest order was received with a black look and
                    grudgingly and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must have caught
                    the infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny,
                    it was plain, hung over us like a thunder-cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. Long
                    John was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in
                    good advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better. He
                    fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all
                    smiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch
                    in an instant, with the cheeriest "Aye, aye, sir!" in the world; and
                    when there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as
                    if to conceal the discontent of the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious
                    anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst.
                    We held a council in the cabin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sir," said the captain, "if I risk another order, the whole ship'll
                    come about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough
                    answer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two
                    shakes; if I don't, Silver will see there's something under that, and
                    the game's up. Now, we've only one man to rely on."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "And who is that?" asked the squire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Silver, sir," returned the captain; "he's as anxious as you and I to
                    smother things up. This is a tiff; he'd soon talk 'em out of it if he
                    had the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him the chance.
                    Let's allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why we'll fight
                    the ship. If they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and God
                    defend the right. If some go, you mark my words, sir, Silver'll bring
                    'em aboard again as mild as lambs."
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men;
                    Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received
                    the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for,
                    and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My lads," said he, "we've had a hot day and are all tired and out of
                    sorts. A turn ashore'll hurt nobody--the boats are still in the water;
                    you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the
                    afternoon. I'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their
                    shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out
                    of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a
                    faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the
                    anchorage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight
                    in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as
                    well he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as
                    have pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day.
                    Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The
                    honest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on
                    board--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the
                    truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the
                    ringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in
                    the main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing
                    to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a
                    number of innocent men.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on
                    board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions
                    that contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by
                    Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and
                    since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party
                    had no present need of my assistance. It occurred to me at once to go
                    ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the
                    fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she
                    shoved off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, "Is that you, Jim?
                    Keep your head down." But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply
                    over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I
                    began to regret what I had done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start
                    and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of
                    her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I
                    had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest
                    thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Jim, Jim!" I heard him shouting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking
                    through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Chapter 14 - The First Blow
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to
                    enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land
                    that I was in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,
                    outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an
                    open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with
                    a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak
                    in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. On the far side of
                    the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining
                    vividly in the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was
                    uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front
                    of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the
                    trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and
                    there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and
                    hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did
                    I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous
                    rattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or
                    evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew
                    low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the
                    foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of
                    one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until
                    it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest
                    of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was
                    steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled
                    through the haze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;
                    a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the
                    whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and
                    circling in the air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be
                    drawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon
                    I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I
                    continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest
                    live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized
                    to be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while
                    in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound
                    they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no
                    distinct word came to my hearing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,
                    for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves
                    began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the
                    swamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since
                    I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the
                    least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my
                    plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the
                    favourable ambush of the crouching trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by
                    the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that
                    still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at
                    last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear
                    down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about
                    with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to
                    face in conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the
                    ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was
                    lifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Mate," he was saying, "it's because I thinks gold dust of you--gold
                    dust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn't took to you like pitch, do
                    you think I'd have been here a-warning of you? All's up--you can't make
                    nor mend; it's to save your neck that I'm a-speaking, and if one of the
                    wild uns knew it, where'd I be, Tom--now, tell me, where'd I be?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Silver," said the other man--and I observed he was not only red in the
                    face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a
                    taut rope--"Silver," says he, "you're old, and you're honest, or has the
                    name for it; and you've money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn't;
                    and you're brave, or I'm mistook. And will you tell me you'll let
                    yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure
                    as God sees me, I'd sooner lose my hand. If I turn agin my dooty--"
                    And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. I had found
                    one of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of
                    another. Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound
                    like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one
                    horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a
                    score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening
                    heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was
                    still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and
                    only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant
                    surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had
                    not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch,
                    watching his companion like a snake about to spring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "John!" said the sailor, stretching out his hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hands off!" cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with
                    the speed and security of a trained gymnast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hands off, if you like, John Silver," said the other. "It's a black
                    conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell
                    me, what was that?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That?" returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye
                    a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero.
                </p>
                    "Alan!" he cried. "Then rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you,
                    John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine
                    no more. If I die like a dog, I'll die in my dooty. You've killed Alan,
                    have you? Kill me too, if you can. But I defies you."
                <p>
                    And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook
                    and set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far.
                    With a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of
                    his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.
                    It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right
                    between the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he
                    gave a sort of gasp, and fell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell. Like
                    enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he
                    had no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without
                    leg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried
                    his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of
                    ambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the
                    next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling
                    mist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going
                    round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells
                    ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together,
                    his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom
                    lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit,
                    cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the
                    steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce
                    persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life
                    cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what
                    speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the
                    wood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old
                    buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As
                    soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce
                    minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the
                    murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into
                    a kind of frenzy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired,
                    how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still
                    smoking from their crime? Would not the first of them who saw me wring
                    my neck like a snipe's? Would not my absence itself be an evidence to
                    them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge? It was all over,
                    I thought. Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA; good-bye to the squire, the
                    doctor, and the captain! There was nothing left for me but death by
                    starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All this while, as I say, I was still running, and without taking any
                    notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two
                    peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew
                    more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and
                    dimensions. Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty,
                    some nearer seventy, feet high. The air too smelt more freshly than down
                    beside the marsh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>
                    Chapter 15 - The Man of the Island 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    FROM the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of
                    gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.
                    My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap
                    with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether
                    bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and
                    shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought
                    me to a stand.
                   
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,
                    before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer
                    the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared
                    less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned
                    on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to
                    retrace my steps in the direction of the boats.
                   
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to
                    head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I
                    rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an
                    adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running
                    manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping
                    almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt
                    about that.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of
                    calling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild,
                    had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in
                    proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of
                    escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed
                    into my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage
                    glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of
                    the island and walked briskly towards him.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must
                    have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his
                    direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated,
                    drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and
                    confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in
                    supplication.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    At that I once more stopped.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Who are you?" I asked.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Ben Gunn," he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward,
                    like a rusty lock. "I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am; and I haven't spoke with a
                    Christian these three years."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his
                    features were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was
                    burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked
                    quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen
                    or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters
                    of old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork
                    was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous
                    fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.
                    About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the
                    one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Three years!" I cried. "Were you shipwrecked?"
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Nay, mate," said he; "marooned."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of
                    punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender
                    is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some
                    desolate and distant island.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Marooned three years agone," he continued, "and lived on goats since
                    then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can
                    do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You
                    mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well,
                    many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke
                    up again, and here I were."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "If ever I can get aboard again," said I, "you shall have cheese by the
                    stone."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing
                    my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of
                    his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow
                    creature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled
                    slyness.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "If ever you can get aboard again, says you?" he repeated. "Why, now,
                    who's to hinder you?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Not you, I know," was my reply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "And right you was," he cried. "Now you--what do you call yourself,
                    mate?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Jim," I told him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Jim, Jim," says he, quite pleased apparently. "Well, now, Jim, I've
                    lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you
                    wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?" he asked.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Why, no, not in particular," I answered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ah, well," said he, "but I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil,
                    pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't
                    tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it
                    begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it
                    begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and
                    predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence
                    that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island,
                    and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just
                    a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound
                    I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim"--looking all round him and
                    lowering his voice to a whisper--"I'm rich."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and
                    I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the
                    statement hotly: "Rich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make
                    a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was
                    the first that found me!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he
                    tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly
                    before my eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?" he asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found
                    an ally, and I answered him at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as
                    you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the
                    rest of us."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Not a man--with one--leg?" he gasped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Silver?" I asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ah, Silver!" says he. "That were his name."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "He's the cook, and the ringleader too."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a
                    wring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If you was sent by Long John," he said, "I'm as good as pork, and I
                    know it. But where was you, do you suppose?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him
                    the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found
                    ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he
                    patted me on the head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You're a good lad, Jim," he said; "and you're all in a clove hitch,
                    ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man
                    to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove
                    a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you
                    remark?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I told him the squire was the most liberal of men.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Aye, but you see," returned Ben Gunn, "I didn't mean giving me a gate
                    to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark,
                    Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say
                    one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I am sure he would," said I. "As it was, all hands were to share."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "AND a passage home?" he added with a look of great shrewdness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Why," I cried, "the squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of
                    the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ah," said he, "so you would." And he seemed very much relieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now, I'll tell you what," he went on. "So much I'll tell you, and no
                    more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and
                    six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us
                    standing off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal,
                    and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in
                    a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about
                    the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead
                    and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was
                    battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy
                    Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him
                    where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like,
                    and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by
                    thunder!' That's what he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this
                    island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find
                    it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a
                    mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had
                    the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As
                    for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and
                    a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for
                    yourself,' they says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian
                    diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I
                    look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I
                    says."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And with that he winked and pinched me hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim," he went on. "Nor he
                    weren't, neither--that's the words. Three years he were the man of this
                    island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe
                    think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of
                    his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part
                    of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)--the most part of his time was
                    took up with another matter. And then you'll give him a nip, like I do."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Then," he continued, "then you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a
                    good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a
                    precious sight, mind that--in a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman
                    of fortune, having been one hisself."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well," I said, "I don't understand one word that you've been saying.
                    But that's neither here nor there; for how am I to get on board?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ah," said he, "that's the hitch, for sure. Well, there's my boat, that
                    I made with my two hands. I keep her under the white rock. If the worst
                    come to the worst, we might try that after dark. Hi!" he broke out.
                    "What's that?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    For just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the
                    echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "They have begun to fight!" I cried. "Follow me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten,
                    while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily
                    and lightly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Left, left," says he; "keep to your left hand, mate Jim! Under the
                    trees with you! Theer's where I killed my first goat. They don't come
                    down here now; they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear
                    of Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there's the cetemery"--cemetery, he must have
                    meant. "You see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when
                    I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel,
                    but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was
                    short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says."
                </p>
                <p>
                    So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley
                    of small arms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I
                    beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood.
